# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Tulane University, with a major field in comparative politics. In Fall 2019, I will be joining Stanford University as a pre-doctoral fellow at the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law for one academic year. 

I study authoritarianism with particular interests in state-business relations and Chinese politics. My dissertation, *"Wealth without Power: The Rise of Chinese Private Business Elites and Their Relationship to the Communist Party‚Äù*, examines how the Party incorporates and controls the rising super rich in China in order to prevent state capture and stay in power. My research on China is part of a broader agenda that looks at the state-business relationship in transitional regimes and authoritarian resilience.

I hold a M.A. in International Affairs from the Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in History (minor in Chinese Literature) from Shanghai Normal University. Before starting my PhD at Tulane, I worked as a junior research scholar at Arizona State University where my work focused on science and technology policy in China. In my leisure time, I enjoy doing Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting.
