# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Tulane University, with a major field in comparative politics. I study authoritariansim with particular interests in state-business relations and Chinese politics. My dissertation, *"Wealth without Power: The Rise of Chinese Private Business Elites and Their Relationship to the Communist Party‚Äù*, examines how the CCP incorporates and controls the rising super rich in China in order to prevent state capture and stay in power since the 1980s. My research on China is part of a broader agenda that looks at the state-business relationship in transitional regimes and authoritarian resilience.

I hold a M.A. in International Affairs from The Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in History from Shanghai Normal University. In my leisure time, I enjoy doing Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting.
