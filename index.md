# Welcome!

I am a Newman Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Oklahoma in the College of International Studies and the Institute for US-China Issues.

My areas of research have been focused on studying communist and post-communist regimes with particular interests in state-business relations and Chinese politics. My book project, *"Wealth without Power: The Rise of Chinese Private Business Elites and Their Relationship to the Communist Party‚Äù* examines how the CCP prevents state capture by incorporating and controlling the rising super-rich in China's private section. My research on China is a part of a broader investigation into the state-business relationships in transitional regimes and authoritarian resilience.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Tulane University in 2021. Between 2019-2021, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University. I hold an M.A. in International Affairs from Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in History (minor in Chinese Literature) from Shanghai Normal University. Before starting my Ph.D. at Tulane, I worked as a research scholar at Arizona State University where my work focused on science and technology policy in China. In my leisure time, I enjoy doing Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting.
