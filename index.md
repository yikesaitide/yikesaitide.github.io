# Welcome!

I am a Newman Psot-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Oklahoma's Institute for US-China Issues in the College of International Studies. 

My research studies authoritarianism with particular interests in state-business relations and Chinese politics. My book project, *"Wealth without Power: The Rise of Chinese Private Business Elites and Their Relationship to the Communist Party‚Äù* examines how the CCP incorporates and controls the rising super rich in China in order to prevent state capture and stay in power. My research on China is part of a broader agenda that looks at the state-business relationship in transitional regimes and authoritarian resilience.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Tulane University in 2021. Between 2019-2021, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University. I hold an M.A. in International Affairs from the Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in History (minor in Chinese Literature) from Shanghai Normal University. Before starting my Ph.D. at Tulane, I worked as a junior research scholar at Arizona State University where my work focused on science and technology policy in China. In my leisure time, I enjoy doing Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting.
