# Welcome!

I am a Newman Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Oklahoma in the College of International Studies. 

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Tulane University in 2021. I hold an M.A. in International Affairs from the Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in History  from Shanghai Normal University. Before starting my Ph.D. at Tulane, I worked as a junior research scholar at Arizona State University where my work focused on science and technology policy in China. In my leisure time, I enjoy doing Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting.
