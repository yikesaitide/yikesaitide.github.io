# Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Politics at [Fairfield University](https://www.fairfield.edu/).

My areas of research and teaching have been focused on studying communist and post-communist regimes with particular interests in state-business relations and Chinese politics. My book project, *"Wealth without Power: The Rise of Chinese Private Business Elites and Their Relationship to the Communist Party‚Äù* examines how the CCP prevents state capture by incorporating and controlling the rising super-rich in China's private sector. My research on China is a part of a broader investigation into the state-business relationships in transitional regimes and authoritarian resilience.

Before joining Fairfield, I was a post-doctoral fellowship at the Newman US-China Center of University of Oklahoma in 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Tulane University in 2021. Between 2019-2021, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University. I also hold an M.A. in International Affairs from Pennsylvania State University, and a B.A. in History (minor in Chinese Literature) from Shanghai Normal University. In my leisure time, I enjoy doing Chinese traditional calligraphy and painting.
