###### My dissertation examines a novel puzzle in state-business relations in modern China. Provided that while business elites in the post-Soviet states have engaged in state capture, how and why has China developed a system of crony communism, in which private business elites aim to neither capture the party-state nor promote democracy? Taking the post-Soviet states as a shadow case, I first compare how Chinese business elites emerged from small cooperatives and start-ups, whereas Russian oligarchs arose by preying on the key state extractive and industrial enterprises. Beyond this historical comparison, using rich archival data of Chinese scholars’ and policymakers’ articles on the Soviet model of economic reform from the Chinese Academy of Social Science, I show how the Party’s leadership took a prudential approach to the process of privatization based on its active learning from the post-Soviet states. Given the Party’s anxiety of its potential rival, I then analyze how the party-state relies on a dual strategy of incorporating (by providing seats in the Congress) and confining (by punishing via state machines) the rising super rich in order to prevent state capture and stay in power. I employ a mixed-method approach, including an original biographical dataset of the top 500 wealthiest people in China, and evidence from an 8-month fieldwork of 75 in-depth interviews with business elites, scholars, and government officials from the United Front Work Department and the Federation of Industry and Commerce in China. I conclude with a discussion of the undesirable consequences of such tactics and what has changed under Xi Jinping.
