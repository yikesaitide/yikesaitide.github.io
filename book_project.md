<sup><sub>My dissertation examines a novel puzzle in state-business relations in modern China. Provided that while business elites in the post-Soviet states have engaged in state capture, how and why has China developed a system of crony communism, in which private business elites aim to neither capture the party-state nor promote democracy? <br/>
I employ a mixed-method approach, including an original biographical dataset of the top 500 wealthiest people in China, and evidence from a fieldwork of 75 in-depth interviews with business elites, scholars, and government officials in four cities.</sub></sup>
