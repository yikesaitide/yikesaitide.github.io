My **dissertation** examines a novel puzzle in state-business relations in modern China. Provided that while business elites in the post-Soviet states have engaged in state capture, how and why has China developed a system of crony communism, in which private business elites aim to neither capture the party-state nor promote democracy? <br/>

I employ a mixed-method approach, including an original biographical dataset of the top 500 wealthiest people in China, archive and government documents, reports from Hurun Research Center, and and evidence from a fieldwork of 75 in-depth interviews with business elites, scholars, and government officials in four cities.

My work details how the super-rich have become a particular target of the CCP, which aims to monitor them, educate them, and channel their involvement in politics in ways that minimize their potential to capture the state and maximize their willingness to cooperate with the regime. Specifically, co-optation is secured through the access to seats in the NPC/CPPCC and coercion is deployed through anti-corruption investigations. This mixed strategy deployed by the CCP has allowed the party-state to embrace and control the super-rich in the private economy.
